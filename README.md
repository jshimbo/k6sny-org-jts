  Sunnyvale ARES Website version 4.0

https://k6sny.org/

Sunnyvale Amateur Radio Emergency Service (SARES) is the local Amateur Radio Emergency Service® (ARES®) group of radio amateur volunteers serving the City of Sunnyvale (California) Department of Public Safety. We provide reliable backup communication links when all else fails.

In January 2024, we merged the SARES and SARES Repeater Group (SARES-RG) websites.

## Technical Overview

This website was built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Instead of writing HTML, we edit Markdown files (which is far simpler) and use MkDocs to create a _static webiste._ A key benefit of static websites is that high quality web hosting is available at no charge.

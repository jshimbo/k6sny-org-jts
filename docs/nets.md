# Nets

## Monday Nights

SARES meets every Monday at 19:30 (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Guests and prospective menbers are welcome.

On most Mondays, we meet on the primary K6SNY repeater, SARES channel 1.

145.170 MHz  
negative offset  
PL 94.8 Hz

We also meet on other repeaters and simplex channels. Please download the Simplex Rotation Schedule ([SARES-simplex-rotation-2024.pdf](https://github.com/saresrg/Net-Control-Docs/releases/latest)).

At 8pm, we transition to the [SPECS Monday Night Net](https://www.specsnet.org/monday-night-net).

After that, typically between 20:10 and 20:20, we return to SARES Channel 1 gather late check-ins and conduct any remaining business.

## Tuesday Nights

The Silicon Valley Emergency Communications System (SVECS) Net starts every Tuesday at 20:00 local time.

The SARES weekly check-in count from the preceding Monday night will be carried over and reported to the SVECS net. If you missed the weekly Monday net and want to check in on Tuesday, you need to do so as "late checkins for Sunnyvale" which will be called on the main SVECS net right after the Sunnyvale representative has reported in.

# Gilroy Fiber Optic Cable Cut

## April 9, 2009

### SARES participation

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

In the early morning of April 9, vandals damaged part of the critical fiber-optic backbone for Southern Santa Clara County, creating a phone outage that affected not only normal phone service, but ATMs, cash registers, cell phones, alarm systems and Internet service.

Santa Clara County put out a call for emergency communication assistance and the Sunnyvale Office of Emergency Services (OES) answered. Under the direction of Lt. John Gienger, volunteer amateur radio operators trained in emergency communications through ongoing participation with the OES sponsored Sunnyvale Amateur Radio Emergency Services (SARES) organization provided emergency communications through the day and into the night at strategic points in the County. Sunnyvale supplied the largest number of amateur radio responders of any city in the North County, providing communication to schools, fire stations, key public access intersections, Cal Fire Command Posts and St. Louise Hospital. Emergency communications throughout the South Santa Clara County continued uninterrupted thanks to these well trained volunteers and their personal equipment, which they keep at the ready for emergencies.

> I would also like to thank each of you for your efforts to help the City of Gilroy respond to the events of April 9, 2009\. This particular emergency situation underscores that our reliance on technology should be balanced with maintaining the very types of capabilities that you provided to us. Communication is an obvious key to adequately responding to any emergency and the efforts of the Mutual Aid Communicators and the Gilroy Police VIP's provided the necessary communication and public visibility in this instance and demonstrated just how important your training and skill is to our community. Thank you very much for your dedication and expertise.

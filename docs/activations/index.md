# Activations and Mutual Aid

SARES' primary mission is to provide communications support and mutual aid during disasters and other emergencies. Some significant events have been:

-   PG&E Public Safety Power Shutoff (October 2019) &#8212; SARES was ready to provide communications in case a planned power shutoff in Sunnyvale affected phone or internet service.
-   Gilroy Communcations Fiber Optic Cable Cut (April 2009) &#8212; Sunnyvale supplied amateur radio responders to provide communication to schools, fire stations, key public access intersections after vandals cut a critical fiber-optic backbone for Southern Santa Clara County.

## May 2008

[CDF Information on Summit Road Incident](http://cdfdata.fire.ca.gov/incidents/incidents_details_info?incident_id=263)

### May 22, 2008

The SARES 440 MHz was linked with the Santa Clara Co ARES / RACES 2 meter repeater to facilitate a Santa Clara Co wide Resource Net, due to the Summit incident. During the linked time the Santa Cruz Co. ARES / RACES EOC was able to communicate with the Santa Clara Co. ARES / RACES EOC. After Santa Clara Co ARES / RACES EOC was closed for the evening the 440 MHz was being used by Cal-Fire VIPs for logistical traffic for VIPs delivering food to the various branches.

Overnight, conditions on the fire change. The fire has jumped Summit road and now is in Santa Clara county. SCCo EOC has been reactivated, and SCCo RACES is active.

Once again our repeater(K6SNY/R) is linked into AA6BT/R for an Santa Clara County ARES/RACES activation. The AA6BT/K6SNY link is being used as a county wide resource net.

>
> I have been told that there will not be a need for RACES responders after 1100 this morning. We will therefore close our operations for today, Sunday, May 25, at that time. However, please "stay tuned", since the fire is not yet out, and there may be future calls for RACES assistance. If such a call occurs, I will send out notice via SCC-EC, MACgroup, and email to cell phones.
